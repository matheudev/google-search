# Project 0 for CS50W: Google Search Replica

This project is a replica of Google's search functionality, built as part of the CS50W course. It includes a main search page, an image search page, and an advanced search page, with CSS designed to closely resemble Google's aesthetics.

### Three Pages

The website includes three pages: 

1. Google Search (index.html)
2. Google Image Search
3. Google Advanced Search

### Links

On the main page, there are links in the upper-right corner to switch to Image Search or Advanced Search. On each of the other two pages, there is a link in the upper-right to return to Google Search.

### Search Functionality

On the Google Search page, users can type in a query and click "Google Search" to be taken to the Google search results page for that query. Like Google's own search bar, the search bar on this page is centered with rounded corners, and the search button is also centered beneath the search bar.

On the Google Image Search page, users can type in a query and click a search button to be taken to the Google Image search results page for that query.

On the Google Advanced Search page, users can provide input for four search fields (all these words, this exact word or phrase, any of these words, and none of these words) and be taken to the search results page for that query. The four options are stacked vertically and all text fields are left-aligned, consistent with Google's own Advanced Search page.

### "I'm Feeling Lucky" Button

The main Google Search page also includes an "I'm Feeling Lucky" button, which takes users directly to the first Google search result for their query, bypassing the normal results page.

### CSS Design

The CSS used on the website closely resembles Google's own aesthetics, based on the dark mode version.

## How to Run

To run the website, simply download the project files and open the index.html file in a web browser.

## Credits

This project was completed as part of the CS50W course, and the specifications for the project were provided by the course staff. The CSS design was based on Google's own aesthetics.
